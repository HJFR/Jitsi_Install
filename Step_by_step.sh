# Ensure support for apt repositories served via HTTPS
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
#Ubuntu requires dependencies from Ubuntu universe package repo enable it with the bellow command
sudo apt-add-repository universe
#retreive the latest package versions

Prepare the DNS server 
Create the A record on your DNS server for the application. 
In the bellow examples we will use the meet.3is.pt
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname meet.3is.pt
#add the same FQDN in the /etc/hosts file:
127.0.0.1 localhost
x.x.x.x meet.3is.pt
#add the prosody package repo for ubuntu 22.x
sudo curl -sL https://prosody.im/files/prosody-debian-packages.key -o /etc/apt/keyrings/prosody-debian-packages.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/prosody-debian-packages.key] http://packages.prosody.im/debian $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/prosody-debian-packages.list
apt install lua5.2
#Add the Jitsi package repository ubuntu 22.x
curl -sL https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/jitsi-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jitsi-keyring.gpg] https://download.jitsi.org stable/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list
#Update all package sources:
sudo apt update

#Setup and configure your firewall
#The following ports need to be open in your firewall, to allow traffic to the Jitsi Meet server:
#80 TCP => For SSL certificate verification / renewal with Let's Encrypt. Required
#443 TCP => For general access to Jitsi Meet. Required
#10000 UDP => For General Network Audio/Video Meetings. Required
#22 TCP => For Accessing your Server using SSH (change the port accordingly if it's not 22). Required
#3478 UDP => For querying the stun server (coturn, optional, needs config.js change to enable it).
#5349 TCP => For fallback network video/audio communications over TCP (when UDP is blocked for example), served by coturn. Required
#If you are using ufw, you can use the following commands:
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 10000/udp
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 3478/udp
sudo ufw allow 5349/tcp
sudo ufw enable
#Check the firewall status with:
sudo ufw status verbose

To be Verfied After Instalation
Advanced configuration
If the installation is on a machine behind NAT jitsi-videobridge should configure itself automatically on boot. If three way calls do not work, further configuration of jitsi-videobridge is needed in order for it to be accessible from outside.

Provided that all required ports are routed (forwarded) to the machine that it runs on. By default these ports are TCP/443 and UDP/10000.

The following extra lines need to be added to the file /etc/jitsi/videobridge/sip-communicator.properties:

org.ice4j.ice.harvest.NAT_HARVESTER_LOCAL_ADDRESS=<Local.IP.Address>
org.ice4j.ice.harvest.NAT_HARVESTER_PUBLIC_ADDRESS=<Public.IP.Address>

And comment the existing org.ice4j.ice.harvest.STUN_MAPPING_HARVESTER_ADDRESSES.

Check if it is Required 

Systemd/Limits: Default deployments will have low values for maximum processes and open files. For greater than 100 participants, change /etc/systemd/system.conf to:

DefaultLimitNOFILE=65000
DefaultLimitNPROC=65000
DefaultTasksMax=65000

To check values just run:

systemctl show --property DefaultLimitNPROC
systemctl show --property DefaultLimitNOFILE
systemctl show --property DefaultTasksMax

Additional Functions
Adding sip-gateway to Jitsi Meet
Install Jigasi
Jigasi is a server-side application acting as a gateway to Jitsi Meet conferences. It allows regular SIP clients to join meetings and provides transcription capabilities.
